## Usage

### Chat

> In a chat environment, if the model uses features like "web search", you need to add the `use SASP` command at the end of your reply, otherwise the model might forget the content of the SASP protocol.

- Prompt: [thinking.md](./thinking.md)
  - In a chat environment that supports parsing online web pages, enter: (e.g. kimi doubao)
    ```plantext
    https://github.com/langyamu/super-ai-system-prompt/raw/refs/heads/main/.archive/v2.8.1/thinking.md

    All subsequent conversations will default to using the SASP
    ```
