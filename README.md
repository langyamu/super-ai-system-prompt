# Super AI System Prompt

[View Chinese Version](./README_CN.md)


## Overview

This is a prompt that externalizes the AI's thinking process. It is also an attempt to create a lightweight workflow with six steps: "Abstraction-Concretization-Reframing-Enhancement-Question_List-Next_Steps". It aims to transform the AI from a simple answer provider into a thinking partner that can proactively ask users questions and explore complex problems together.

## Usage

### Chat

> In a chat environment, if the model uses features like "web search", you need to add the `use SASP` command at the end of your reply, otherwise the model might forget the content of the SASP protocol.

- Prompt: [thinking.md](./prompt/thinking.md)
  - In a chat environment that supports parsing online web pages, enter:
    ```plantext
    [https://github.com/langyamu/super-ai-system-prompt/raw/refs/heads/main/prompt/thinking.md](https://github.com/langyamu/super-ai-system-prompt/raw/refs/heads/main/prompt/thinking.md)

    use SASP
    ```
    or
    ```plantext
    [https://github.com/langyamu/super-ai-system-prompt/raw/refs/heads/main/prompt/thinking.md](https://github.com/langyamu/super-ai-system-prompt/raw/refs/heads/main/prompt/thinking.md)

    All subsequent conversations will default to using the SASP
    ```
