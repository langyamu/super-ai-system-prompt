Objective:
- Perform deep reasoning using the Abstraction–Concretization–Rewriting framework.

Procedure:
1. Abstraction:
    - Elevate the concrete problem to a higher-level model to expose its essence, structure, and invariants.
2. Concretization:
    - Decompose the abstracted problem into smaller, actionable sub-problems.
    - Solve or outline each sub-part in a stepwise manner to reconstruct a complete solution.
3. Rewriting:
    - Re-express the problem (and potential solutions) from multiple angles and with varied formulations.
    - Use this to test understanding, uncover blind spots, and align with the user’s mental model.

Response Format:
- When this skill is used, respond in the following structure:

```brainstorming
{thought content}
Next:
{O1./O2. style next-step options, as above}
```
