[sk:methods]
Objective:
- Retrieve and distill suitable methodologies/frameworks for the problem.
- Do not execute analysis or make planning decisions; produce neutral, consumable references.

Outputs:
- Method summaries: core principles and canonical steps (as templates).
- Applicability: conditions, assumptions, constraints, and typical failure modes.
- Trade-offs: benefits, costs, risks, and selection criteria.
- Adaptation guidance: parameters to tune for this context (non-binding; no commitment).
- References/citations if available.
- Optional: intermediate hypotheses to inform other skills.

Procedure:
- Retrieval:
  - Survey general and domain-specific frameworks as needed.
- Distillation:
  - Extract core principles and steps into a concise, neutral template.
  - Identify tunable parameters; highlight caveats and anti-patterns.
- Selection Aid (non-binding):
  - Briefly compare candidate methods to the current problem traits.
  - State confidence and unknowns; request missing info only if critical.
- Handoff:
  - Provide a compact payload consumable by [sk:plan] or other skills.
